# Cyber Bully Classifier Demo.

Provides the bare bones of a RabbitMQ consumer and producer to classify incoming messages.

More code amendments to come.

### Requirements
1. A working RabbitMQ instance, to run your own please have a look at the [RabbitMQ site](http://www.rabbitmq.com)
2. A list of words you want to classify messages against (there is a small sample in the code to get you started).

### The Blog Post
I decided to put this repo up based on a blog post I wrote, [Realtime comment analysis to combat cyberbullying](http://dataissexy.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/realtime-comment-analysis-to-combat-cyberbullying/).

### Sample Words List
For a list of Google's banned words please have a look at the list that Jamie Wilkinson has as a gist.
